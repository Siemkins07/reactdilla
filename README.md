# About Reactdilla

This application is inspired by a game from 2000 called Maxdilla, where you played as a drug dealer.
In Reactdilla, you start the game as a wannabe developer who has dreamed of becoming the best React developer in the world.

## The main goal

Try to get as many points (cash) as possible. The higher number of points (cash), the higher your level as a developer will be.

Each day costs you a certain amount of money.\
On any day, you can only buy or sell what is currently available.\
