# About Reactdilla

This application is inspired by a game from 2000 called Maxdilla, where you played as a drug dealer.
In Reactdilla, you start the game as a wannabe developer who has dreamed of becoming the best React developer in the world.

## The main goal

Try to get as many points (cash) as possible. The higher number of points (cash), the higher your level as a developer will be. 

## Mechanics

You start the game with debt, which increases by interest every day.
Each day costs you a certain amount of money.
On any day, you can only buy or sell what is currently available.
You can have a limited amount of goods.
By visiting the hospital you can improve your health.
You can take out loan to buy more items at an attractive price (good but risky option).
